\title{Insert dummy cities into a distance matrix}
\description{
  Inserts dummy cities into an object of class \code{TSP}.  A dummy city has
  constant distance (0) to all other cities and is infinitely far from other
  dummy cities. A dummy city can be used to transform a shortest Hamiltonian
  path problem (i.e., finding an optimal linear order) into a shortest
  Hamiltonian cycle problem which can be solved by a TSP solvers 
  (Garfinkel 1985).
  
  Several dummy cities can be used together with a TSP solvers to perform
  rearrangement clustering (Climer and Zhang 2006).
  }
\usage{
insert_dummy(x, n = 1, const = 0, inf = Inf)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{an object of class \code{TSP}.}
  \item{n}{number of dummy cities.}
  \item{const}{distance of the dummy cities to all other cities.}
  \item{inf}{distance between dummy cities.}
}
\details{
  The dummy cities are inserted before the other cities in \code{x}. 

  A \code{const} of 0 works if the TSP finds the optimal solution. For
  heuristics returning suboptimal solutions, a \code{const} of \code{2 *
  max\{x\}} seems to work well.
