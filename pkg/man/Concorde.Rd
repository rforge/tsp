\title{Using the Concorde TSP Solver}
\description{
  The Concorde TSP Solver package contains several solvers. 
  Currently, interfaces to
  the Concorde solver (Applegate et al. 2001), one of the most
  advanced and fastest TSP solvers using branch-and-cut, and
  the Chained Lin-Kernighan (Applegate et al. 2003) 
  implementation are provided in \pkg{TSP}.
  
  The Concorde TSP Solver package is freely available for academic 
  research and has to
  be obtained separately from the Concorde web site (see details).
}
\usage{
## set path for executables
concorde_path(path)

## obtain a list of command line options for the solvers
concorde_help(exe = NULL)
linkern_help(exe = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{exe}{ an optional character string containing the whole path to the
      executable (including the executable's name). 
      
      Other options are (1) to use \code{concorde_path()} to set the path to
      the directory  containing the executables for concorde and linkern, or
      (2) to put the executables somewhere in the search path.
      }
  \item{path}{path to the directory where the executables are stored.}
}
\details{
The code of the Concorde TSP package is not included in this package and has to
be obtained separately from the Concorde web site (see references).  Either
download the precompiled executables and place them in a suitable directory
(either in the search path, or you have to use \code{concorde_path()}) and
make them executable, or you can get the source code and compile it on your
own.

To get a list of all available command line options which can be used via the
\code{clo} option for \code{solve_TSP} use \code{concorde_help()} and
\code{linkern_help()}.  Several options (\option{-x}, \option{-o},
\option{-N},  \option{-Q}) are not available via \code{solve_TSP} since they
are used by the interface.
